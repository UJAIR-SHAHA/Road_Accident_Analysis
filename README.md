# Road Accident Analysis Tableau Project

## Overview
The Road Accident Analysis project aims to uncover key insights and patterns from accident data using Tableau. This project provides a visual representation of accident trends, locations, causes, and other influencing factors to help stakeholders understand and address safety issues on roads.

## Objectives
- Analyze road accident data to identify trends and patterns.
- Visualize key metrics such as accident severity, frequency, and contributing factors.
- Provide actionable insights to improve road safety and reduce accidents.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes the following attributes:
- **Date and Time:** Timestamp of the accident.
- **Location:** Geographic location of the accident.
- **Weather Conditions:** Weather at the time of the accident.
- **Road Surface Conditions:** Information on whether the road was wet, dry, or icy.
- **Vehicle Types:** Types of vehicles involved in the accidents.
- **Casualties:** Number of people injured or killed.
- **Accident Severity:** Classification of accidents based on the level of impact (e.g., slight, serious, fatal).
- **Light Condition:** Lighting conditions during the accident (e.g., daylight, night with streetlights).
- **Number of Vehicles:** Total vehicles involved in each accident.
- **Road Type:** Type of road where the accident occurred (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway,roundabout,one way street,slip road).
- **Urban or Rural Area:** Whether the accident took place in an urban or rural area.

## Key Visualizations
1. **KPI and Area Chart:** Displays the number of accidents, total casualties, fatal casualties, serious casualties, and slight casualties for the current and previous year.
2. **KPI for Casualties by Vehicle Type:** Highlights the distribution of casualties based on the type of vehicle involved.
3. **Pie Chart for Casualties by Weather Type:** Illustrates how weather conditions affect the number of casualties.
4. **Pie Chart for Casualties by Road Surface Type:** Shows the distribution of casualties based on the type of road surface.
5. **Bar Chart for Casualties by Road Type:** Visualizes casualties across different road types.
6. **Filters:** Interactive filters for selecting the current year, previous year, and specific types of casualties.



## Tools and Technologies
- **Tableau:** For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Excel/CSV:** For data preprocessing and cleaning before importing into Tableau.

## Process
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered road accident data from reliable sources.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values, standardized formats, and removed outliers.
3. **Data Visualization:** Created dashboards in Tableau to highlight patterns and trends.
4. **Insights Generation:** Derived key takeaways and recommendations based on visualizations.

## Challenges
- Handling incomplete or inconsistent data.
- Integrating multiple data sources into Tableau.
- Designing intuitive dashboards for diverse audiences.

## Future Scope
- Incorporating real-time accident data for live monitoring.
- Expanding the dataset to include more regions and years.
- Using predictive analytics to forecast accident trends and identify potential high-risk areas.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of Tableau in analyzing and visualizing complex datasets. The insights generated can help policymakers and safety organizations implement targeted interventions to enhance road safety.
